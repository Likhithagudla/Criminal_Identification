# Criminal Identification Using Image Recognition 
In this project, we have developed a system for detecting criminal faces, for this, we have used deep learning 
algorithms. Deep learning is currently the most well-known technique, and it is utilized in a variety of 
applications. One such application is crime detection and prevention. The criminal's face is recognized by this 
system, which then obtains the criminal's database information. In this application detect image and video for 
criminal identification. Once select the image to identify it results whether the person is criminal or non-criminal. 
It will simplify the investigation process. We use pre trained convolution neural network architecture called VGG16. 
It can classify the images among 1000 categories. We collected our datasets from NIST special datasets 18. 
This project will identify whether the person is criminal or noncriminal. It can able to run in a real time. this 
project can able to process video and detect the identity of the person through video only if the person is criminal. 
Otherwise, recognize as non-criminal.
